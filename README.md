A repo for storing the programs I created during my studies (mostly programs written in Python).

### Probability and statistics
1. estimate_std_with_bootstrap 
Program for estimate the standard deviation using the bootstrap method with 100 bootstrap samples from the original sample [10, 20, 11, 23, 15, 17, 14], and find the 90% confidence interval for that standard deviation.
2. testing_uniformity
My goal is to "verify" a (pseudo)random number generator that produces numbers from a "uniform distribution". Accomplish this, I propose and conduct experiments to investigate whether the numbers generated by the respective function can indeed be considered as numbers derived from a uniform distribution. In solving this problem, I will utilize the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test to assess the distribution compatibility.
3. checking_with_chi2
Generating a simple random sample of size 50 from a pair of random variables (S, Z), where S = X + Y and Z = X - Y, and X, Y are independent random variables following the distributions B(20, 1/2) and B(10, 1/4), respectively. Perform a chi-squared test at a significance level of 0.1 to assess the independence of the random variables S and Z.
